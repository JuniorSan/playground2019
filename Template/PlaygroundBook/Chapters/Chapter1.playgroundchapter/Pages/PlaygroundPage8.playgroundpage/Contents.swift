 # About me
 
 
 My name is Rennan Rebouças, I'm 28 and I'm Computer Engineering student at Instituto Federal do Ceará, Brasil.
 This idea of ​​the programmer having super powers always blom my mind 🤯. I always make this explanation when explain to my friends what I do. and I like to pass the idea that everyone has super powers. With super heroes everything becomes more fun 😁, all programs, applications and solutions that made me more excited to work are the ones that make me improve something. I already worked on building applications focused on the help of forests and the environment. When I saw all my effort contributing to nature I saw the power I have in my hands.
 So I decided to show that people have great powers in their hands, engeniers, doctors, architects,teachers among others and the world would become better if we used to do good. 😉
