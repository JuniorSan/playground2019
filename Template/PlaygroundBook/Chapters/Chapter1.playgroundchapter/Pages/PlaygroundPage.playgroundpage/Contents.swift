 People in coast environments have been increasing over the years and, unhappily, the preservation is not being done in the right way.
 Most of the sea trash is plastic. Factors like, improper disposal by costumers, vessels dumping oil on the oceans and lack of selective garbage collection, make serious problems to ecosystem.

 This pollution of the oceans has been negatively affecting marine life, causing water warm up, destruction of marine animal habitats, acidification of the oceans and corals.
