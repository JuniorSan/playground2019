 # The Power
 ## A developer decides to use her super power
 
 - Note:
 Here we will incorporate a programmer to understand better the idea of â€‹â€‹using our skills in big actions.
 
 
A beach of Fortaleza-CE, in Brazil, called Beira Mar, is suffering major pollution from bathers, local fishing and neighboring boats. A developer who lives near the area always visited the beach and realized that it has been getting dirtier over the years and decide to do something to help.
 
 She knows that's a major problem and involves many sectors such as people, factors and environments, but is not discouraged by adversity. ðŸ¤“
  In her years of life, her acquired some skills like searching information, application of agile methodology to organize their ideas using the CBL*, assemble prototypes of possible scenarios for solutions
 and use the programming to apply all your knowledge in practice.
 
 + Important:
 *Challenge Based Learning, CBL is a multidisciplinary approach to teaching and learning that encourages students to use technology  applied in their daily lives to solve real world problems.
