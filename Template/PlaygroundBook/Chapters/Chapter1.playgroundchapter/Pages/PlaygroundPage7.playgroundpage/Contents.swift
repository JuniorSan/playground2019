 The programmer realized that her abilities had great power on that beach, she helped to improve:

* Quality of marine animals' life.
* Improve the beach environment.
* Promote a culture of cleaning to the local people and this has since spread to tourists.
 
 She saw herself as a heroine and thought of doing this with other beaches, forests or any other biome. She found other people that shared her ideals, and they formed a team of developers with superpowers to make the world a better place.
