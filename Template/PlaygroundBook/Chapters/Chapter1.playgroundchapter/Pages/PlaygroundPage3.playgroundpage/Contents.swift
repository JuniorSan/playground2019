 # The Act
 ## The surveys generate posibilities
 
 - Important:
 Here we are going to help our Developer, lets organize the information in a document to organize the ideas.
 
 The first thing she did was a research on the marine ecosystem in that region.
 She found that plastics have a high rate of release of pollutants and toxicity, and may be altered by exposure to ultra violet rays and salt water.
 Fish, or any type of marine animal that feeds on these materials, got the risk of contamination.
 People who eat these fish will also have a risk to geting sick. Beyond visual pollution, the garbage causes the destruction of corals and algae from the shore, causing the decrease of fauna of the region.
 She decided to gather all this information pass on to people , but for this she needs your help.
 
 
 ### Search:
 * Marine ecosystem chart.
 * Presearch the damage caused in fish.
 * Garbage images discarded.
 
 
# instrutions
