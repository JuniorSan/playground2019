 - Important:
 Here we are going to help our Developer, lets organize the information in a document to organize the ideas.
 
 The first thing she did was made a research on the marine ecosystem in that region.
 She found that plastics have a high rate of absorption of pollutants and toxicity, and may be altered by exposure to ultra violet rays and salt water, and joining the plankton.
 Fish, or any type of marine animal that feeds on these materials, got the risk of contamination.
 People who eat these fish will also become risk of contamination. Beyond visual pollution, the garbage causes the destruction of corals and algae from the Costa Marinha, causing the decrease of fauna of the region
 She decided to gather all this information pass on to people, but for this she needs your help. Tap the items around the Mac to help organize them.
